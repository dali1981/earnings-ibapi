## 📈 **Business Logic**

The system understands that:
- **Calendar spreads** work best with time decay (14+ days out)
- **Straddles** need volatility expansion (close to earnings) 
- **Strangles** are cheaper volatility plays with wider strikes
- **High IV symbols** (GME, AMC) favor volatility strategies
- **Stable symbols** (SPY, ETFs) favor time decay strategies
- **Liquid options** are required for all strategies

This replaces your manual TradingView workflow with intelligent automation that finds and scores opportunities across the entire market.

## 🎉 **Result**

You now have a system that automatically:
1. **Replaces TradingView earnings checking** with automated market scanning
2. **Identifies the best opportunities** across the entire market  
3. **Scores by strategy suitability** (not just proximity)
4. **Prioritizes data collection** for only the most promising setups
5. **Exports actionable trading lists** with clear next steps
